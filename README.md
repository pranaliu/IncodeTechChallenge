# Incode Tech Challenge - Tower of Hanoi Game
# This Program illustrates GUI representation of tower of Hanoi Game.
# Minimum disks needed for this game are 3.
# Maximum disks program can accept is 10. However this program is scalable and can take higher positive number of disks too.
# This program is restricted to play with maximum of 10 disks, so that canvas can accomodate correct number of disks and give good user experience.
# Algorithm used here is recursive to create game structure.
# Improvement needed to scale this program is - game canvas should be able shrink or expand based on number of disks to play with.
# This prgram can be made online with the help of JAVA web start technology.

# Java 9 includes the jmod and jlink tools, which are capable of creating a file tree with an executable shell script or .bat file. A major advantage is #that you can build such a tree for any platform, regardless of your own platform, if you unpackage the foreign platform’s JDK on your machine. Another 
# advantage is that the user doesn’t need to have Java installed at all. A disadvantage is that the script requires a terminal, unless running on Linux.
